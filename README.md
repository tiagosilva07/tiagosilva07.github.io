Hello everyone this is my personal page and was inspired in the work of [Cristian Mihai](https://www.youtube.com/@cristianmihai01). 
I follow is work and for me this guy is pretty amazing on is skills for css and frame-motion.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
It uses [Frame motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and some reusable components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
For stylling it uses [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/)

## Getting Started
If you dont have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) please install it on your machine.
After get the source code from git and on the root folder please run npm install.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
